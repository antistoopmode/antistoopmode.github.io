# Uber Bosses 
Uber bosses are the aspirational content in Hero Siege 2. They are level 200+ and require a well geared hero in order to defeat them. These bosses drop a guaranteed boss set item. If you die inside an uber boss dungeon, you won't be able to return and have to pay the entry fee again.

## Uber Damien
To summon Uber Damien, you need to brim "Um", in the "Town of Inoya" (Act 1), a "Key of Terror" and he will open  portal to Fallen Inoya. The "Key of Terror" can be crafted at the cube with the six Prime Evil Artifacts ("Gurag's Soul", "Death's Sigil", "Damien's Eye", "Anubis' Ankh", "Karp King's Bellybutton" and "Satan's Horn").
