# Defenses for Beginners
Mitigating Damage in Hero Siege 2 is a big part of the game (especially if you're playing Hardcore). Attacks (melee and ranged) are the only type of damage that can be avoided. The chance to avoid the damage depends on your Defense Rating and is between 5% and 95%.

Step 0: Don't get hit by staying out of range or moving out of the projectile trajectories.

Step 1: Avoidance (only applies to Attacks)
- [Defense] 
- [Defense vs Missiles]

Step 2: Mitigation for Physical Damage 
- [Physical Damage Reduction] / [Damage Reduction]

Step 2: Mitigation for Elemental Damage Mitigation
- [Resistance] 
- [Elemental Damage Reduction] / [Damage Reduction]

Step 3: Life Pool
- [Life]

Step 4: Recovery
- [Life After each Kill]
- [Life stolen per Hit] (only applies to Physical Attacks)

Capping your Resistances should be your highest priority. Physical Damage Reduction should be next on your list, although it's hard to come by. Defense is nice, but way too unpredictable.
