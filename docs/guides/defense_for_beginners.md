# Defenses for Beginners
Mitigating Damage in Hero Siege 2 is a big part of the game (especially if you're playing Hardcore). Attacks (melee and ranged) are the only type of damage that can be avoided. The chance to avoid the damage depends on your Defense Rating and is between 5% and 95%.

Step 0: Don't get hit by staying out of range or moving out of the projectile trajectories.
